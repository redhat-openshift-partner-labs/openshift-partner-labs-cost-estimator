## Migration Guide

### Upgrading to v1.0.0 (Unified Discovery)

**Recommended**: Use the new unified discovery method for better performance and coverage:

```bash
# Old method (still supported)
python aws/main.py --cluster-uid your-cluster-uid

# New method (recommended)
python aws/main.py --cluster-uid your-cluster-uid --unified-discovery
```

**Benefits of Unified Discovery**:
- Single API call vs multiple service calls
- Automatic discovery of all AWS services
- Enhanced resource enrichment
- Better error handling and performance

**Required Permissions**: Add `resourcegroupstaggingapi:GetResources` to your IAM policy.

### Upgrading from v0.1.x to v0.2.0

**Enhanced Cost Calculations**: No breaking changes, but cost calculations are now more accurate for stopped instances and include proper operational cost estimates.
